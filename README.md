# 18DOF Muto RS Hexapod Robot ROS2 for Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson NANO
![](https://category.yahboom.net/products/muto-rs)
# Introduction
Muto RS is a desktop-level bionic hexapod robot developed and designed based on the ROS2 operating system and compatible with Jetson NANO and Raspberry Pi. The overall body is made of aluminum alloy and contains 18PCS 35KG serial bus servos, depth cameras, lidar, voice modules. Through Python3 programming and built-in high-precision algorithms, Muto RS can easily implement AI visual interaction, 3D mapping navigation, voice interaction, deep learning, Rviz simulation. Based on multi-machine communication technology, we can also allow Muto to complete multi-machine synchronization control and multi-machine navigation. Users can control it by APP, wireless handle, and computer web pages. Muto is not only suitable for learning algorithms for multi-legged bionic robot movement, but is also a good platform for ROS developers.
